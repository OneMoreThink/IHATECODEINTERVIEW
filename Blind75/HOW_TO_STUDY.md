# How to Study with This Repository

This guide outlines a structured approach to studying the Blind 75 problems, focusing on pattern recognition for coding interviews.

## The Goal

The primary goal is not just to solve the problems, but to **identify the underlying patterns** and understand **when to apply them**. This repository is designed to become your personal knowledge base of common interview patterns.

## The Workflow

For each problem, follow these steps:

### 1. Understand the Problem
- Read the problem on LeetCode carefully.
- Try to solve it on your own for a limited time (e.g., 15-20 minutes). Don't worry if you can't find the optimal solution. The goal ㅛis to engage with the problem.

### 2. Study the Optimal Solution
- Look up the optimal solution and understand it thoroughly. The "Solutions" tab on LeetCode is a great resource.
- Focus on **why** this solution is optimal. What data structure or algorithm is the key?

### 3. Document the Pattern (`README.md`)
- Fill out the `README.md` file for the problem using the established template. This is the most important step.
- The template is designed to capture the essence of the pattern:
    - **Core Idea:** What is the key pattern? (e.g., Hash Map, Two Pointers, Sliding Window).
    - **When to Think of This Pattern?:** What "signals" in a problem description suggest this pattern? This is crucial for applying your knowledge to new problems.
    - **Algorithm:** A step-by-step description of the optimal approach.
    - **Complexity:** The time and space complexity of the optimal solution.

### 4. Implement the Code
- Write the code for the optimal solution in both `solution.cpp` and `solution.swift`.
- This reinforces your understanding of the algorithm and helps you practice implementing it cleanly in your chosen languages.

## The Outcome

By following this process, you will build a repository that serves as a quick-reference guide. Before an interview, you can review the `README.md` files to refresh your memory on key patterns, when to use them, and how they work.
