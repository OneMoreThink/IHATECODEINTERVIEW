# My Blind 75 Journey

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the [Blind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind-75) list of LeetCode problems. The goal is to practice for technical interviews by focusing on recognizing and articulating common coding patterns.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **`/Blind75`**: Contains solutions for the Blind 75 problems.
  - Each problem has its own directory (e.g., `1-Array/001-Two-Sum`).
  - Inside each problem's directory, you will find:
    - `README.md`: A script detailing the thought process for solving the problem in an interview setting.
    - `solution.cpp`: The C++ implementation.
    - `solution.swift`: The Swift implementation.
- **`/DataStructures`**: Contains notes and implementations of common data structures.
- **`/Algorithms`**: Contains notes and implementations of common algorithms and patterns.
- **`/.vscode`**: Contains VS Code configurations for building and debugging C++ and Swift code.

## 🧠 Study Workflow

The approach for each problem is as follows:

1.  **Understand & Attempt:** Read the problem and attempt a solution for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Study Optimal Solution:** Analyze the best possible solution to identify the key data structure or algorithm.
3.  **Document in Interview Style:** Fill out the problem's `README.md` by scripting the entire thought process, from clarifying questions to arriving at the optimal solution and stating its complexity.
4.  **Implement:** Write the code for the optimal solution in both C++ and Swift to solidify understanding.

This process emphasizes clear communication, which is a critical skill in technical interviews.
